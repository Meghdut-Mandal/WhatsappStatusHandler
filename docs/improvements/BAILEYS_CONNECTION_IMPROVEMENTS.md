## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Browser Configuration Benefits
According to the Baileys guide, using desktop browser configuration provides:
- Better message history (up to 90 days vs limited mobile history)
- More stable connections
- Enhanced features support
- Better QR code reliability

### Connection Flow
```
1. User visits /auth page
2. QRDisplay component loads
3. Calls /api/auth/qr (GET) to fetch QR
4. BaileysManager creates socket with enhanced config
5. QR code generated and displayed with countdown
6. Real-time status polling starts
7. User scans QR code
8. Connection established
9. "Connected to Bot" message sent automatically
10. UI updates to show success state
```

### Event Handling
The improved system emits several events:
- `status_update`: Connection status changes
- `qr_code`: New QR code generated
- `connection_message_sent`: Confirmation message sent

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/auth` page
3. QR code will auto-generate with countdown timer
4. Real-time status updates will show connection progress

### For Users
1. Open the web app and go to authentication page
2. Scan the QR code with WhatsApp (it shows expiry countdown)
3. Wait for connection confirmation
4. Check WhatsApp for "Connected to Bot" message
5. Start using the status handler features

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```bash
node scripts/test-connection-improvements.js
```

The test validates:
